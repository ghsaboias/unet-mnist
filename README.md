Project Outline:

Setup: Use Python with PyTorch or TensorFlow.
Data: Load the MNIST dataset (easily available in most ML libraries).
Model: Create a simple U-Net architecture (commonly used in diffusion models).
Diffusion Process: Implement a basic forward and reverse diffusion process.
Training: Train the model to denoise digits (this might take a few hours on a Mac).
Generation: Use the trained model to generate new digits from random noise.
Visualization: Create a simple interface to watch the denoising process step-by-step.
